# User Card â€“ React Practice Project

This project is part of a personal series of React exercises focused on improving fluency, architectural clarity, and emotionally intelligent UI design.

## Purpose

To practice:

- Modular React components with scoped CSS
- Async state management using context and reducer
- Editorial documentation for onboarding and interview defense
- Clean, accessible UI without external styling frameworks

## Features

- Displays user cards with name, age, profession, and avatar
- Edit modal with controlled form using a custom reducer hook
- Responsive grid layout using pure CSS
- Emotionally clear structure and naming for onboarding clarity

## Structure

- `context/`: Async reducer and context logic
- `components/`: Modular UI (Card, EditModal, HeaderNav, FooterInfo)
- `hooks/`: Custom form reducer for controlled inputs
- `styles/`: CSS modules for scoped styling

## Notes

This repo is part of the **React Practice Series**, a collection of small projects designed to:

- Reinforce reusable patterns
- Improve technical storytelling
- Build confidence in architectural decisions

Each project is:

- Small in scope, big in clarity
- Documented for onboarding and reuse
- Designed to turn friction into fluency

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

- Add loading and error states to async context
- Expand form reducer to support validation
- Create variants of the Card component (`compact`, `highlighted`, etc.)

For practicing React and improving proficiency.
